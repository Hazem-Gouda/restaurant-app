### 🥗 About the Project

A modern, responsive **Restaurant App** for my ex-real restaurant :( , now fully migrated to the **Next.js** framework. This project serves as **Version 2** of the application, focusing on improved performance, SEO, and modern tooling while maintaining the core functionality: allowing users to browse a menu and view contact info.

This version leverages **Next.js** capabilities for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) where appropriate, offering a faster and more robust user experience than the previous React-only setup.

### 🚀 Key Features (Next.js v2)

- ⚡ **Enhanced Performance:** Utilizes Next.js optimization features like **Image Component** and automatic code splitting.
- ⚙️ **Routing:** Leverages Next.js's built-in file-system routing.
- 📋 Browse menu items with images, descriptions, and prices.
- ➕ Add and remove items from the cart.
- 🚀 Uses **Redux** state management (as learned in V1) for complex state needs.
- 📱 Fully responsive layout with **Bootstrap**.
- ♿ Improved Accessibility (a11y) for better user experience.
